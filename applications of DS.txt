Applications of stack :

Used by the compiler in order to check the syntax
it usd in paranthesis checking

i ) conversion of infix to postfix expression
    the converted expressions can be easily evaluated by the compiler.  

ii ) Delimiter checking

iii ) Recursion

iv ) Undo functions

Graphs - Connections/relations in social networking sites,
 Routing ,networks of communication, data organization etc.

Google maps uses graphs for building transportation systems, where intersection of two(or more) roads are considered to be a vertex 
and the road connecting two vertices is considered to be an edge

Facebookâ€™s Friend suggestion algorithm uses graph theory.
Facebook is an example of undirected graph.

web pages are considered to be the vertices.
 There is an edge from a page u to other page v 

I Operating System, we come across the Resource Allocation Graph where each process 
and resources are considered to be vertices.
